### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I'm a software craftman at [Mindvalley](https://www.mindvalley.com). Previously worked on digitalizing Malaysia grocery shops with my **superpower**(**Elixir** and **Swift**) and also help to make cashless payment more convenient to Malaysian. I'm also a tools maker. I love **Rust** so I make a Rust web framework([obsidian](https://github.com/obsidian-rs/obsidian)) and a utility tool([aion](https://github.com/jk-gan/aion)) for it. I make tools for **React Native** developer as well ([redux-flipper](https://github.com/jk-gan/redux-flipper) & [flipper-plugin-redux-debugger](https://github.com/jk-gan/flipper-plugin-redux-debugger)) to help them debug redux state on their app. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- **Rust**
- **SwiftUI**
- **Elixir**
- **What is in my brain**
