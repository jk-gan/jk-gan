### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software craftman who working on [JiMATSHOP](https://www.jimatshop.com/) & [JiMATBIZ](https://www.jimatbiz.com/) to help digitalizing Malaysia grocery shops with my **superpower**(Elixir and Swift). I'm also a tools maker. I love **Rust** so I make a Rust web framework([obsidian](https://github.com/obsidian-rs/obsidian)) and a utility tool([aion](https://github.com/jk-gan/aion)) for it. I make tools for **React Native** developer as well ([redux-flipper](https://github.com/jk-gan/redux-flipper) & [flipper-plugin-redux-debugger](https://github.com/jk-gan/flipper-plugin-redux-debugger)) to help them debug redux state on their app.
